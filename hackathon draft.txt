PROJECT: Skin Cancer Detection with Heatmap: Normal AI imaging only shows the probability of skin cancer, but this often leads to doctors not trusting it due to the black box nature of the AI. Our medical imaging model will create a heatmap of the affected areas and display the image for the doctors, leading to greater trust in the AI system, with help of OpenCV and Grad-CAM

Required Downloads (compulsory on one device:)

python 3.11+
git
pip
python-dotenv
HAM - 10000 dataset
monk skin (MST) by google 1k skin colours
OpenCV
GradCAM + pytorch (cu12 for GPU runtime) // "pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126"
scikit
pandas 
numpy
seaborn
pillow - img processing
scipy
albumentations
antigravity IDE
vscode
tqdm
fiftyone
medmnist
streamlit

recommended space: 15 gb

implementation plan:

i) skin identifier (is the image uploaded by the user actually a skin sample?)
ii) dullrazor algorithm


iii) melanoma blue-ruler grid on patch ("AI often learns that "Blue Plastic = Cancer" because rulers are only used when a doctor is worried.")
iv) trust layout - 
	a. original img
	b. cleaned image - dullrazor result
	c. gradcam heatmap
	d. mst score (1-10 depending on skin tone) // streamlit dashboard!

......

team responsibility:
Anwesh: team lead; implementation of python dullrazor + gradcam
Aditya: streamlit dashboard
Dipak: mst score, removal of blue ruler, fiftyone curation (write the script to detect the medical blue + mst score to prove it works on all skin colours)

deadline (19 feb) for draft:
13/14/15 weekend

13 - download all requirements, git repo + skin id + dullrazor algorithm if possible 
14,15 - gradcam heatmap + training
16,17,18 - mst score + streamlit dashboard

after preparation done:
keep pre-trained MST scorer
use weights='IMAGENET1K_V2'
Use pytorch-grad-cam; do not write gradients from scratch
fix environment

pre-save some work on a different git account.
......

during hackathon:
re-implement
